## Differences from sei40kr/zsh-fast-alias-tips <a id='differences'></a>

I've been using the original plugin from [@sei40kr](https://github.com/tsu1980) for many years.
However, since 2020 the project is not receiving much attention from the author, with issues and PRs not being addressed.

So I decided to fork the project to address some of the issues and PRs, which resulted even in refactoring and restructuring.

Here's the full list of changes between this fork and the original project:

* Zsh plugin is released together with binary, so second repo is not needed.
* Golang upgraded to 1.20.
* It's possible to compile the plugin's binary on installation.
* Configuration variables are prefixed with plugin name (`ZSH_FAST_ALIAS_TIPS_`).
* `def-mathcer` renamed to `zsh-alias-matcher` to provide more context.
* The plugin doesn't not require binary to be in `PATH`.
* Repo is structured as a common Golang package (with `cmd` and `internal`).
* Fixed `Makefile`.
* Added ci job to GitHub workflow, which will run [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and tests.
* Do not show tip if input command is shorter ([#27](https://github.com/sei40kr/zsh-fast-alias-tips/pull/23)).
* Build binary for Apple Silicon ([#26](https://github.com/sei40kr/zsh-fast-alias-tips/pull/26)).
* Zsh plugin file renamed to match the plugin name ([#25](https://github.com/sei40kr/zsh-fast-alias-tips/pull/25)).
* It's possible to exclude some unwanted aliases with `ZSH_FAST_ALIAS_TIPS_EXCLUDES` ([#24](https://github.com/sei40kr/zsh-fast-alias-tips/issues/24)).
* Some code refactoring to improve readability. For example - `Abbr` renamed to `Expanded`.
